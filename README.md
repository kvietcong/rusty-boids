# 💻 🦀 rusty-boids 🐟 🐦
Using Rust and the Bevy game engine to make a simple boids simulation. Maybe real-time adjustable settings soon? (Maybe I'm too lazy 🤣)

This is the first time I've messed around with the ECS architecture after watching a few cool talks about it.

This is also the first time in a while that I've touched Rust. It's all spaghetti code 🍝
